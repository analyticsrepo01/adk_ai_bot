**Essential Components:**

*   `__init__.py`
    *   Must import the agent module: `from . import agent`
    *   This makes your agent discoverable by ADK
*   `agent.py`
    *   Must define a variable named `root_agent`
    *   This is the entry point that ADK uses to find your agent

**Command Location**

Always run adk commands from the parent directory, not from inside the agent directory
Example: Run `adk web` from the parent folder that contains your agent folder

This structure ensures that ADK can automatically discover and load your agent when running commands like `adk web` or `adk run`.

## Getting Started

This example uses the same virtual environment created in the root directory. Make sure you have:

*   Activated the virtual environment from the root directory:
    *   **macOS/Linux:** `source ../.venv/bin/activate`
    *   **Windows CMD:** `..\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    *   **Windows PowerShell:** `..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
*   Set up your API key:
    *   Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the `adk_ai_bot` folder
    *   Add your Google API key to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file

## Running the Example

To run this basic agent example, you'll use the ADK CLI tool which provides several ways to interact with your agent:

1.  Navigate to the parent directory containing your agent folder.
2.  Start the interactive web UI: `adk web`
3.  Access the web UI by opening the URL shown in your terminal (typically `http://localhost:8000`)
4.  Select your agent from the dropdown menu in the top-left corner of the UI
5.  Start chatting with your agent in the textbox at the bottom of the screen

## Troubleshooting

If your agent doesn't appear in the dropdown menu:

*   Make sure you're running `adk web` from the parent directory, not from inside the agent directory
*   Check that your `__init__.py` properly imports the agent module
*   Verify that `agent.py` defines a variable named `root_agent`

## Alternative Run Methods

The ADK CLI tool provides several options:

*   `adk web`: Launches an interactive web UI for testing your agent with a chat interface
*   `adk run [agent_name]`: Runs your agent directly in the terminal
*   `adk api_server`: Starts a FastAPI server to test API requests to your agent
