Basic ADK Agent Example

What is an ADK Agent?

The LlmAgent (often aliased simply as Agent) is a core component in ADK that acts as the "thinking" part of your application. It leverages the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) for:

Reasoning
Understanding natural language
Making decisions
Generating responses
Interacting with tools
Unlike deterministic workflow agents that follow predefined paths, an LlmAgent's behavior is non-deterministic. It uses the LLM to interpret instructions and context, deciding dynamically how to proceed, which tools to use (if any), or whether to transfer control to another agent.

Required Agent Structure

For ADK to discover and run your agents properly (especially with adk web), your project must follow a specific structure:

parent_folder/
    agent_folder/         # This is your agent's package directory
        __init__.py       # Must import agent.py
        agent.py          # Must define root_agent
        .env              # Environment variables
Essential Components:

__init__.py

Must import the agent module: from . import agent
This makes your agent discoverable by ADK
agent.py

Must define a variable named root_agent
This is the entry point that ADK uses to find your agent
Command Location

Always run adk commands from the parent directory, not from inside the agent directory
Example: Run adk web from the parent folder that contains your agent folder
This structure ensures that ADK can automatically discover and load your agent when running commands like adk web or adk run.

Getting Started

This example uses the same virtual environment created in the root directory. Make sure you have:

Activated the virtual environment from the root directory:
# macOS/Linux:
source ../.venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD:
..\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell:
..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Set up your API key:
Rename .env.example to .env in the greeting_agent folder
Add your Google API key to the GOOGLE_API_KEY variable in the .env file
Running the Example

To run this basic agent example, you'll use the ADK CLI tool which provides several ways to interact with your agent:

Navigate to the 1-basic-agent directory containing your agent folder.
Start the interactive web UI:
adk web
Access the web UI by opening the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:8000)

Select your agent from the dropdown menu in the top-left corner of the UI

Start chatting with your agent in the textbox at the bottom of the screen

Troubleshooting

If your agent doesn't appear in the dropdown menu:

Make sure you're running adk web from the parent directory (1-basic-agent), not from inside the agent directory
Check that your __init__.py properly imports the agent module
Verify that agent.py defines a variable named root_agent
Alternative Run Methods

The ADK CLI tool provides several options:

adk web: Launches an interactive web UI for testing your agent with a chat interface
adk run [agent_name]: Runs your agent directly in the terminal
adk api_server: Starts a FastAPI server to test API requests to your agent
